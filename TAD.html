                <p>
                  CalFresh can help your family get access to healthy food. You
                  can use CalFresh benefits at most grocery stores and even
                  farmers markets to buy items such as bread, nuts, rice, and
                  more.
                </p>

                <h3>Who is eligible for CalFresh?</h3>
                <p>
                  Individuals and families including U.S. citizens, legal
                  residents, and noncitizens with certain immigration statuses
                  may be eligible for CalFresh.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Getting food benefits doesn’t affect you or your family’s
                  immigration status. Immigration information is private and
                  confidential.
                </p>
                <p>
                  People 60+ and disabled may have a higher income and still
                  qualify.

                  and meet certain rules, such as having income under the

                  You may qualify for health insurance even if you are not a
                  U.S. citizen or a U.S. national.

                <h3>Additional Proof for Health Coverage</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Info about any job related health insurance that is open to

                <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
                <p>
                  The State must decide within 45 days for a Medi-Cal
                  application that doesn't involve a disability. However, you
                  may hear back sooner.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you have a disability, the process may take up to 90 days.
                  This depends on how quickly you submit the supporting papers
                  and when your doctors submit your records.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To stop delays, please submit all papers as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To speed up the process, tell us if you have an urgent medical
                  or dental need. This could be a serious illness or if you are
                  pregnant.
