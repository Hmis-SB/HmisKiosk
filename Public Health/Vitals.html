        <p>If your baby was born at a birthing center, at home or any other location other than a hospital, this is considered a Out of Hospital Birth.  The Vital Statistics Registration Office is required to register the birth within 21 days of the birth. This is the responsibility of the licensed midwife if they were present, or the parents if the birth was unattended.</p>
        <h3>Midwife Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>Professionally licensed midwifes that attend an out-of-hospital birth, it is their duty under Health and Safety Code (HSC) sections 102400 and 102415 to register the birth with the local registrar within twenty-one days of the date of birth.</p>
        
        <h3>Documentation to register your child’s birth are listed below:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Proof of Pregnancy Letter (should include LMP, expected due date, number of visits, and must be signed by doctor or midwife. Also, must be printed on medical office letterhead and have <b>original signature</b> with license number.)</li>
          <li><b>Current</b> ID or driver’s license</li>
          <li>Affidavit with original signature by the midwife</li>
          <li>Ambulance report (if applicable)</li>
          <li>Proof of Residency (utility bill) if baby was born at home</li>
          <li>Newborn Screening Test form if one was performed or refused</li>
          <li>Out-of-Hospital Worksheet(s)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For babies born outside a licensed birthing hospital whether at a Birthing Center, at home, or another location, you will need to apply with the Social Security Administration (SSA) office directly for your child’s social security number.

        <p>A: If the father’s name is not added to the Birth Certificate at the time of birth, the parents must sign an Acknowledgement of Paternity form (VS22) along with a Declaration of Paternity. If you were married at the time of birth you must send a copy of your Marriage Certificate.</p>
        <h3>Q: When can I pick up a Certificate?</h3>
